Task 8: Stored Procedures and Functions.

Objective:
Learn to create and use reusable SQL blocks using Stored Procedures and Functions in MySQL.

Tools:
MySQL Workbench (preferred)
DB Browser for SQLite (note: SQLite does not support stored procedures/functions directly — use MySQL for this task)

Deliverables: DB Browser for SQLite / MySQK Workbench.

Key Concepts:
Stored Procedure: A saved SQL block you can execute later — often used for performing actions (like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).
Function: Returns a single value — often used in queries for calculations or data transformation

Outcome: Ability to modularize SQL logic.
